## Glitch Image Arrays

###  by [Juliet Buck](www.julietbuck.com)

Go to the Terminal window (Mac) and type in:

	"cd "
(don't forget the extra space), cd = change directory Linux command and drag GlitchImageArrays folder onto the terminal window.


In the Terminal Window

	 python -m SimpleHTTPServer 8080

In your web-browser (testing in Chrome)


	 http://localhost:8080/

This should display p5.js sketch

Note: I'm using 8080 as the port, but this can be other numbers as well.
